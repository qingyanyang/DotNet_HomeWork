## Assignment Content:

    1. Create a Console Application to record student information with the following requirements:
    • Ask for the number of students to be recorded.
    • Use the Console to input student information: Name, Age, Courses (optional: you can add other information as needed).
    • Once the number of students reaches the specified amount, print the formatted output in the order: Name, Age, Courses.
    • If the entered information is clearly incorrect, display an error message (for example, Age <18 or >60, or you can design your own criteria for name length).
    2. Based on the recorded student information, sort the students by age in ascending order and print the student information in the same format.
    3. Implement a name search for students:
    • Search for students by name in the recorded list. If a student with the searched name exists, print the student information (Name, Age, Courses). If not, output “Not Exist.”

## The exercise aims to assess:

    • Familiarity with creating a new C# Console program
    • Familiarity with implementing input and output in a Console App
    • Understanding of the array data structure
    • Ability to use loops
